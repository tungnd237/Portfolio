I implemented a voting application with MERN stack that interact with Etherum testnet with Solana and smart contract. This project included: 

â€¢ A blockchain-based decentralized voting system with deployed smart contracts on Ethereum and Solana blockchains to ensure transparency and security. This will enhanced system trust by implementing tamper-proof and transparent voting logic.
