I worked as a part-time at Technica AI, an startup based in Hanoi. My job involved:
- Developed a Japanese chatbot AI using open-source LLMs (Llama-3, llm-jp), RAG/indexing, rerankers, and advanced prompting (CoV, CoT), automating 95% of responses.
- Led a project to clean datasets and predict old car auction prices, deploying an AI API with low MAPE, contributing to a 50% revenue increase. Innovated a group-based approach for car price prediction, using multiple models.
- Crawled and cleaned datasets for breathing events (Apnea, Hypo-apnea) to improve event detection.
- Built time-series models for Apnea detection using transformers/classical models, achieving 80% recall for CPAP machines.
